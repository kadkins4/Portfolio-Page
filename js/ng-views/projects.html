      Below is a list of some of the projects that I have completed as well as some that are still in progress.  There is a description of each project, technology used, collaborators (if any), and a link to the project and its corresponding GitHub. If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR; for most I have next steps/features listed on the README.md, if I am currently planning any additional features.
