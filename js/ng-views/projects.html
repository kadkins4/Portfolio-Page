      Below are a list of some of the projects that I have completed as well as some that are in progress.  There is a description of each project, technology used, collaborators, and a link to the project and it's corresponding GitHub. If you would like to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR, for most I have next steps listed on the README.md if I am currently planning any additional features.
