Ideas to be introduced to portfolio
  - animated person on the side (aside section)
  - each link have an animation
  - education program
  - two prong site — regular is business/extremely professional … click toggle for 2eLLs version



— Fix the background: Setup three main DIVs — using flex have the two on the outside using ``space-between`` but with no space between them and the middle… set the background img for those as the transparent backing — with the body/html as whatever bg color desired — use the middle div as the container for actual content
	- justify-content: space-between
	- align-items: stretch



- Mobile first approach? Develop for small screens and change as screen gets larger
