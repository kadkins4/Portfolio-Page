# Kendall Adkins Portfolio Page

## About
  This is the github repository for my portfolio page which can be found at kendalladkins.me.  I am **always making improvements and am taking suggestions, tips, or bug alerts, etc** but will not be accepting any PRs on this with code as I want this to be entirely coded on my own.  If you would like to contact me, send me a message on here or contact me using one of my social media platforms found on my site.

## Tech Used
  - HTML5/CSS3
  - AngularJS
  - Eventually, I will add in a backend (Leaning towards Rails)

## Other Projects
  Feel free to check out my other projects, most should have a README about the processes I took already and the steps that I am looking to take in the future (in addition to, how you can submit PRs, suggestions, etc.)

### Take care,
### Kendall
